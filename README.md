## Description
DesoLib or Darky's Elder Scrolls Online Library ~~is~~ was a tool to track dungeon achievements in The Elder Scrolls Online written in C# und WinForms. This is was one of my very first projects and while I don't plan to maintain it I decided not to delete it as a reminder of the beginning of my programming journey.
